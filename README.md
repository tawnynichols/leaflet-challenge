# leaflet-challenge

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Used the URL of this JSON to create a map (Leaflet) that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The map included the following features:
- Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
- Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- The legend provides context for the map data.
