# leaflet-challenge

The USGS provides earthquake data in several different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Used JSON to create a map (Leaflet) that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The map includes the following features:
- Data markers reflect the earthquake's magnitude by their size and depth of the quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear more extensive, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
- When the user clicks on the marker, popups provide additional information about the earthquake.
- The legend provides context for the map data.

A second plot was created to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Layer controls were added to the map with overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
